Version 0.7.1
  * KIJIHIVE-40. Escape all inferred class names from complex types to avoid
      Hive reserved words in DDL statement generation.

Version 0.7.0
  * KIJIHIVE-35. Fixed an NPE when fetching a non-primitive value from a map
      type family.
  * KIJIHIVE-2. Improved the generation of CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statements.
      Complex data types should now be supported, and this functionality can be
      invoked as part of the kiji CLI tool, or via the bento-hive.sh script.
  * KIJIHIVE-39. Force user classes to take precedence in MapReduce jobs
      created from within Hive.

Version 0.6.0
  * KIJIHIVE-33. Fixed a ClassCastException issue when reading from a
      SpecificRecord.  Thanks Scott!
  * KIJIHIVE-32. Added support for reading Avro enumerations as Strings.

Version 0.5.0
  * KIJIHIVE-29. Updated KijiTableInputFormat to use Kiji interfaces for
      determining split information.
  * KIJIHIVE-20. Kiji Hive Adapter now supports writing of primitive types.
      Any tables that already exist in the Hive metastore need to be recreated
      in order to take advantage of the new classes.  See README.md for more
      details.

Version 0.4.1
  * KIJIHIVE-26. Default to HBaseRowKey when EntityId components aren't present.

Version 0.4.0
  * KIJIHIVE-23. Updates to Kiji Hive Adapter to become compatible with 
      KijiSchema 1.1.x.
      - Kiji Hive Adapter now uses Hive 0.11, which is included in CDH 4.2.1.
      - Refactored Kiji Hive Adapter to use Hadoop Writable objects internally
        for transferring data around within Hive, this eliminates the need to
        track the schema table for decoding of HBaseResults in evaluation.

Version 0.3.0
  * KIJIHIVE-19. Allow ability to read entity ids up through to Hive. 
      Thanks Jeff!
