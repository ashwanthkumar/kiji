# KijiModeling #

KijiModeling is designed to provide an intelligent modularization of the model development cycle
with Kiji, facilitating the iterative process of model development, as well as bridging the gap
between development and deployment.

It uses [KijiExpress](https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-express/) within some of the phases to
define operations on data.

KijiModeling is still under heavy development, stay tuned for more instructional documentation as
the API stabilizes!
