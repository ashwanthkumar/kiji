* ROW KEY FORMAT should support different hash types.
* `DESCRIBE EXTENDED t` should describe the row key format.
* Implement: CREATE TABLE .. USING n REGIONS (WITH lg_clause...)

* When 'enabled' is real:
** support ALTER TABLE ENABLE/DISABLE FAMILY/COLUMN/LOCALITY GROUP for the enabled flag.
** DESCRIBE should only show enabled data, unless extended is true.
** DUMP DDL should only dump enabled data, until we can set disabled to true.

* When you start the shell, create the kiji instance if it doesn't already exist.
